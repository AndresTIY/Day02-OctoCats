## CSS Style Alignment Exercise
* Trying to put all images within the same row
* Separated per class name
* .octocat
 * used `.octocat img {}` as a selector, got some desired results
* `.octodex` class allowed the images to be displayed side by side using `display: inline-flex` & `float: left`
* tried doing the same thing for the author images under class name `.authors`, but the same properties didn't work with `float: right`
*
